Roadmap for v0.8.0
==================
[x] Agent should get initial response uris before doing anything else
    - This serves a couple of purposes:
        1. Agent no longer hardcodes any of the response uris, except for the
           response uri API. Thus making the response uris dynamic.
        2. The agent continues trying to get the response uris from the server
           after a failure, with pauses in-between, before doing anything else.
           This makes sure that the agent doesn't waste any cycles if the server
           is down or the agent has a bad connection.
    [x] Agent should not process any results before getting the initial response
        uris, otherwise the agent doesn't know where to respond to with the
        results.

[ ] Change authentication/communication with the server
    - Every message to the server should have the authentication token placed in the
      headers of the message, following the format denoted at:
      "https://github.com/vFense/vFense/wiki/Agent-communications"
        -- Due to this, the agent is no longer required to login to the server
           before sending any messages, because each message contains the
           authentication token.
    [ ] Change the agent.config, installer, and config loader/saver functions to 
        take into account this new change.
        [ ] Change the uri used to verify token, during installation, once the
            proper API has been created.
        [ ] Change the install documentation to reflect the new options when installing.

[ ] Replace all traces of Customer with Views in agent
    - Add the Views to the JSON sent on a New Agent operation.
    - Server expects Views to be a list of Views (str). The list should be empty
      when no views have been specified.

[ ] Add Tags to the agent
    - Add the Tags to the JSON sent on a New Agent operation.
    - Server is expecting Tags to be a list of Tags (str). The list should be empty
      when no tags have specified.

[ ] Implement operation ttl's
    [ ] server_queue_ttl should be checked before placing operation in queue
    [ ] agent_queue_ttl should be checked before processing an operation and
        while it's processing as well.

[ ] Retrieve url used to check for agent update from server instead of hardcoding
[ ] Add proxy settings to agent

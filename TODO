Roadmap for v0.8.0
==================
[x] Agent should get initial response uris before doing anything else
    - This serves a couple of purposes:
        1. Agent no longer hardcodes any of the response uris, except for the
           response uri API. Thus making the response uris dynamic.
        2. The agent continues trying to get the response uris from the server
           after a failure, with pauses in-between, before doing anything else.
           This makes sure that the agent doesn't waste any cycles if the server
           is down or the agent has a bad connection.
    [x] Agent should not process any results before getting the initial response
        uris, otherwise the agent doesn't know where to respond to with the
        results.

[ ] Change authentication/communication with the server
    - Every message to the server should have the authentication token placed in the
      headers of the message, following the format denoted at:
      https://github.com/vFense/vFense/wiki/Agent-communications.
        -- Due to this, the agent is no longer required to login to the server
           before sending any messages, because each message contains the
           authentication.
    [ ] Change the agent.config, installer, and config loader/saver functions to 
        take into account this new change.

[ ] Implement operation ttl's
[ ] Add proxy settings to agent
